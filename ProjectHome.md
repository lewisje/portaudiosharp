**PortAudioSharp** implements **.NET bindings** for the cross-platform low-latency audio library **[PortAudio](http://www.portaudio.com) v.19**.

These bindings provide a `PortAudio` class which maps directly the [PortAudio.dll](http://portaudiosharp.googlecode.com/files/PortAudio.dll) methods, and a simplified higher-level `Audio` class.

This library requires .NET 2.0 or the latest version of Mono and doesn't use "unsafe" code.
Should work on any platform supported by .NET or Mono, including Windows, Linux and Mac OS X.

This project is still in alpha stage and may not work on some combinations of OS/Api host.

Please help us testing, debugging and improving this library!
